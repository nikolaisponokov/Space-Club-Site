            <p>
                Space Club is a clothing brand dedicated to being yourself and doing whatever it is that 
                makes you happy no matter what that may be, no matter what others think about it.
                We are a brand for those who are unafraid and unapologetic about who they are inside.
                Originally started by Evan "Vegas" McGahen, Jaden "Beanzo Breezy" Kubasiak, and Jarid 
                "Soryn" Anderson, the brand is now run by Jaden in honor of Evan and Jarid, who are no
                longer here with us.
